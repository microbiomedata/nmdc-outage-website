The infrastructure that powers this NMDC service is currently undergoing some scheduled maintenance. As a result, this NMDC service will be offline until **October 5, 2023 at 12:00pm PT**.

In case you want to explore NMDC metadata between now and then, you can visit a temporary [snapshot](https://data-microbiomedata.emsl.pnnl.gov/) of the data portal. You can also visit our [website](https://microbiomedata.org/) to learn more about the NMDC.

> Please refrain from **submitting** metadata to the snapshot's submission portal. Metadata submitted there will **not** be transferred to the permanant data portal (it will be discarded).
